    "desc": "Finding the best curling irons isn’t so cut and dry: While there are the obvious details to consider, like price point, aesthetic and user feedback, there are major elements to take into account as well, such as performance, maneuverability, temperature range and barrel size. I also paid close attention to the smaller yet still important details that help determine how likely you’d be to use the tool again and again. Maneuverability: To gauge ease of use, I measured factors such as weight, button placement, cord length and swivel. I wanted to be sure I wasn’t getting too strenuous of a workout while using each tool. One of the curling irons I tested slightly exceeded 1.5 pounds and very quickly gave my muscles a burn. I found that the ideal weight falls somewhere around 9 ounces because it’s not too heavy, nor do the materials feel flimsy. And since there’s nothing worse than accidentally changing the temperature or shutting off your curling iron every time you pick it up, I noted the button placement on each tool. It’s best when they are tucked away under the clip or stealthily incorporated into the design and out of the way—like the knob on the bottom of the T3 SinglePass Curl 1.25-inch Professional Curling Iron. Cord length is important; the longer, the better. The cords on the tools I tested range from 5 to 9 feet long. The 5-foot cord felt incredibly limiting; even with an outlet next to my mirror, I felt like I was tugging at the cord to work the barrel at my roots. And when it comes to storage, the extra length doesn’t add much bulk anyway. A swiveling cord is a must for preventing kinks and tangles while you maneuver your curling iron. I found this on all of our corded contenders except for the Hot Tools Pro Artist 24K Gold Curlbar, which didn’t require it because of its particular design. Temperature: A curling iron’s heat setting is among the most important criteria to consider when selecting the right tool for your hair type. You want it to get hot enough to impart a long-lasting curl, but not so much that it singes your strands. A broad range ensures that thin or damaged hair types can benefit from the lower heat settings, while thick, coarser hair works best with the higher ones. Some come with preset temperature settings, while others feature a dial or digital gauge for customized heat preferences. I also noted the heat-up time and whether the curler features an automatic shut-off for safety. Performance: To test the performance of each curling iron, I considered how easily and quickly the tool created and set the style. This includes the tension on the iron’s clamp: The perfect one holds your hair taut without snagging it or leaving an indentation in your curl. Once my hair was done, I monitored how the style held up over time throughout the day and into the second day. Barrel: The width and length of barrels vary, and they cater to different hair types. While most curling irons follow a standard length, some feature an extra inch or two that make them ideal for longer hair, since they can distribute heat more evenly. In my testing, I considered whether a curling iron is offered in multiple sizes, which provides more options to accommodate user preferences. My hair is long and thick, with an inconsistent wave pattern throughout that can skew frizzy at times. To keep testing fair, I took the same steps with each curling iron. I always started with freshly washed, conditioned and air-dried hair, then spritzed a heat protectant throughout (I used this Amika one). I divided my hair into 2-inch sections, beginning at the nape of the neck and working my way up to the hairline. I assessed how quickly the curling iron worked, how smoothly my hair released from the barrel and how well the curl held its shape throughout the day and into the next morning. I did a mirror check every 2 hours over the course of 8 hours, and I evaluated the state of my curls first thing the next day. I omitted all finishing or holding sprays to truly put each tool to the test. Over the course of a week, Gutterman tested our top contenders while at work, prepping on-air talent on ESPN. She used each tool on three different hair types: One was thick, wavy and color-treated; another was curly and frizzy; and the third was healthy, uncolored hair. She noted the curl patterns, ease of use, overall feel of the hair and how long the styles lasted. Gutterman assessed the results four times over 2 days, including immediately after styling, 1 hour later, 8 hours later and the next morning."

    "desc": "There are many reasons why an eternity ring may be given perhaps as an anniversary present or a celebratory gift to mark a special moment in a relationship such as the birth of a child. Eternity rings are normally comprised of a band of precious metal set with a continuous line of identically cut diamonds or gemstones to symbolise neverending love. Nothing says ‘I’m in this for the long haul’ like presenting your loved-one with an eternity ring. These days, couples give each other eternity rings for all sorts of romantic reasons, but have you ever wondered who started the whole thing and why we wear them on our wedding ring finger? Well, wonder no more, with our list of 10 fascinating facts about these beautiful pieces. 1. The concept of an eternity ring can be traced back 4,000 years to the ancient Egyptians, who were said to offer them as a token of both eternal love and life. Early examples consisted of a circle of metal set with stones either on the top half of the ring or spanning the whole circumference. Some designs featured a serpent devouring its own tail, signifying infinity and the cycle of birth and death, referred to as the ‘ouroboros’. 2. Eternity rings today still come in half or full-eternity options, featuring precious stones usually set in gold or platinum. That said, the creative possibilities are endless. While they can feature any gem of choice, the most popular stone, unsurprisingly, is the diamond. With their incredible strength and durability, diamonds have, for centuries, symbolised unwavering devotion, fidelity and friendship. And, of course, they are the most precious stone, so no surprises they top the list when it comes to romantic gestures. But diamonds are also said to represent the future, acting as a promise of an eternal life of closeness together. When set in an eternity ring, this message is magnified by encircling the finger in a never-ending band of meaning. 3. The popularity of the diamond eternity ring dates back to the 1960s and it’s all thanks to a clever advertising campaign by diamond merchant DeBeers. According to an investigative journalist named Edward Jay Epstein, the company had a secret deal with the Soviet Union whereby it agreed to purchase 90-95% of the uncut diamonds produced by Russia in return for a single channel controlling the world’s supply of these precious gems. These Soviet diamonds were small (often less than 0.25 carats) so, to avoid stockpiling, DeBeers came up with a cunning plan. They used the delicate stones to make eternity rings and promoted them as gifts for husbands to give their wives. One advertising slogan read: ‘She married you for richer or poorer. Let her know how it’s going.’"

    "desc": "Are sunglasses just another stylish accessory or are they the key to good eye health? “There’s definitely a fashion element to sunglasses that people look for, but there are health benefits to wearing sunglasses as well,” says Elliot Levine, M.D., an ophthalmologist at Piedmont. The most important benefit of wearing sunglasses is that they protect your eyes from ultraviolet (UV) light. UV light can have harmful effects on the eyelid, cornea, lens and retina. Do you only wear sunglasses on sunny summer days? If so, you’re doing your eyes a disservice. Sunglasses are necessary year-round says Dr. Levine. “Whether it’s winter or summer, cloudy or sunny, you’re always subject to ultraviolet exposure,” he says. Eye protection is especially important if you’re on or near a body of water. “Not only do you get direct sun exposure, but you also get reflected light from the water,” he says. Snow can also reflect sunlight, so if you’re hitting the ski slopes this winter, don’t forget your sunglasses. Excessive UV exposure can lead to a corneal burn. Dr. Levine says there are several details you should consider for when selecting a new pair of shades: 100 percent UV protection. This means your pair will filter out all of the harmful UV rays that can damage your eyes. A wraparound style. They can reduce the amount of UV exposure to your eyes. Polarization. This optional feature reduces glare, which can be more comfortable for your eyes. Tinting. The color of your sunglasses is purely cosmetic, says Dr. Levine, so choose a pair that best suits your taste. Just be sure they are labeled as having 100 percent UV protection. Should great shades cost a fortune? Dr. Levine says no. “You can get good glasses for $5 or you can get glasses that are much more expensive,” he says. The biggest difference between inexpensive and high-end sunglasses? More expensive versions have better frames, he says. “Less expensive glasses may not be as cosmetically appealing; however, as long as there is 100 percent ultraviolet protection, that’s the most important thing.”"
